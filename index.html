<h1>Meme Coin: Trump v Biden</h1>

Total 1,000,000,000 tokens. 
10% held for Dev team
10% retained in locked liquidity 
5% to fund marketing/growth/advisors from June to Nov.
40% initial launch - June 1
35% (remaining) to be released end of 31 July.

The idea is that we have a web 3 site that allows holders to make transfer tokens to TRUMPs ELECTION POOL or BODENs ELECTION POOL,
Any donation made, 25% for of both candidates tokens will be staked until election day in separate liquidity pools.
At the end of the election the loser's respective liquidity pool will be burned. And the winner's can be unstaked by holders. 


Remaining tokens can continue to trade on market. 

After the election, the 50% liquidity pool tokens allocated to the loser of the Elections will be burned, and the remaining 50% of the winner tokens can be unstaked and transferred back to wallets... 

After the election, the remaining tokens can continue to trade, perhaps after a makeover to present the winner... .
